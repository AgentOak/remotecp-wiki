Follow this steps to install remoteCP-3:

    * Download and unzip the ZIP-file into a directory on your webserver
    * Open */xml/servers.xml* and edit the serversettings
    * (linux only) CHMOD *771* all files in the directory */xml/*
    * (linux only) CHMOD *771* the directory */images/cache/*
    * Open your remoteCP-3 and login the first time with Username: *admin* and Password: *admin*
    * Select the Maintenance tab and change your admin password
    * (optional) You can also change the system settings to your needs. Take a look into */xml/settings.xml*


== Serversettings ==
The */xml/servers.xml* file is very important, for a well running remoteCP-3 system. You have to set up your server config there. Without a valid *servers.xml*, remoteCP-3 wont run probably!

Most of the file should be selfexplaining but keep an eye on the values of account and password, it's very important that this matches the SuperAdmin data from your servers *dedicated.cfg* file!
