# What is remoteCP? #

remoteCP is a TrackMania dedicated server manager, it helps maintaining your maps, players, server settings and many other things.

Please note that remoteCP-4 wont support the old Trackmania Original and Trackmania Sunrise Servers! You should use remoteCP-3 for this servers, the supported feature-set is nearly completed.

## **Important information for remoteCP-4 users** ##
It is possible to open and read all XML Files (in some case also .bat and .sh) in any webbrowser, by directly calling the URL of that file. For example:

  * http://www.yourdomain.com/remoteCP4/xml/servers.xml

This will cause a major security problem if you don't use the .htaccess file delivered with the remoteCP-4 download. You shouldn't delete or change that file in any case, if you don't know what your doing.
Please read this for further informations about htaccess:
